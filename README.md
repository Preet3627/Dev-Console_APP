Dev-Console is an advanced, AI-powered suite that streamlines how you build, debug, and manage WordPress sites. It combines a powerful AI assistant with a comprehensive set of development tools to help you go from concept to deployment faster than ever before.

## ✨ Features

- **AI Co-Pilot:** An intelligent assistant that can generate code, manage your site, troubleshoot errors, and execute complex tasks using natural language.
- **Multi-Provider AI Support:** Switch between different AI providers, including Google Gemini, OpenAI, Claude, Groq, Perplexity, and even a local LLM.
- **Progressive Web App (PWA):** The application is a fully offline-capable PWA, allowing you to use it even without an internet connection.
- **Enhanced Code Editor:** A polished code editor with syntax highlighting, file history, and a more robust layout.
- **On-Device AI (Autocomplete):** The Co-Pilot chat now features a basic on-device autocomplete for common commands, accessible with the Tab key.
- **Secure & Multi-User:** Built with security in mind, featuring JWT authentication, Google Sign-In, and an admin panel for user management.
- **Unified Management:** A single, elegant dashboard to manage plugins, themes, and core files.
- **Safe Database Interaction:** Browse database tables and use the AI assistant to query data with safe, pre-defined commands.
- **Diagnostics & Optimization:** Run Google PageSpeed audits, scan for security vulnerabilities, and get AI analysis on your debug logs.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- A MySQL-compatible database

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Preet3627/Dev-Console_APP.git
    cd Dev-Console_APP
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    - Create a `.env` file in the root of the project by copying `.env.example`.
    - Fill in the required environment variables, especially for your database and JWT secret.

4.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start the Vite frontend and the Node.js backend concurrently. You can access the application at `http://localhost:5173`.

## 🖥️ Desktop Application (Tauri)

The project is set up to be packaged as a cross-platform desktop application using Tauri.

**Note:** The build process for the desktop application is currently blocked because it requires the Rust toolchain (including `cargo`) to be installed on your system.

Once you have installed Rust from [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install), you can build the application with:

```bash
npx tauri build
```

This will generate executables for your platform in the `src-tauri/target/release` directory.
